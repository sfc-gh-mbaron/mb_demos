# MFA Token Caching Configuration Guide

This guide shows how to configure MFA token caching to reduce authentication prompts during demo execution.

## Overview

Snowflake's MFA token caching stores your MFA token securely for up to **4 hours**, dramatically reducing the number of MFA prompts you'll receive during demo testing and development.

## Prerequisites

1. **Account Setup**: MFA token caching must be enabled at the account level (run `setup_mfa_caching.sql`)
2. **Client Support**: Your Snowflake client must support MFA token caching
3. **Secure Storage**: The `keyring` package must be installed for Python connections

## Configuration Methods

### 1. SnowSQL (Command Line) - Recommended for Demo

**Environment Variables Method:**
```bash
# Set these environment variables to reduce prompts
export SNOWSQL_ACCOUNT="your-account-identifier"
export SNOWSQL_USER="your-username"  
export SNOWSQL_PWD="your-password"
export SNOWSQL_ROLE="your-role"
export SNOWSQL_DATABASE="RDF_SEMANTIC_DB"
export SNOWSQL_SCHEMA="SEMANTIC_VIEWS"
export SNOWSQL_WAREHOUSE="RDF_DEMO_WH"

# Enable MFA token caching (already done by deployment script)
snowsql -f setup_mfa_caching.sql

# Now run demo commands - you'll only get MFA prompts once per 4-hour session
snowsql -f sql/01_setup_environment.sql
snowsql -f python_udfs/rdf_parser_udf.sql
# ... additional commands will reuse cached MFA token
```

**SnowSQL Config File Method:**
Create/update `~/.snowsql/config`:
```ini
[connections.demo_connection]
accountname = your-account-identifier
username = your-username
password = your-password
dbname = RDF_SEMANTIC_DB
schemaname = SEMANTIC_VIEWS
warehousename = RDF_DEMO_WH

# Use MFA token caching
authenticator = username_password_mfa
```

Then use: `snowsql -c demo_connection -f your_script.sql`

### 2. Python Connections (for Custom Scripts)

**Install Required Package:**
```bash
# Install with secure storage support
pip install "snowflake-connector-python[secure-local-storage]"
```

**Python Connection Code:**
```python
import snowflake.connector

# Create connection with MFA token caching
conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
    account='your-account-identifier',
    user='your-username',
    password='your-password',
    authenticator='username_password_mfa',  # Enable MFA caching
    database='RDF_SEMANTIC_DB',
    schema='SEMANTIC_VIEWS',
    warehouse='RDF_DEMO_WH'
)

# First connection will prompt for MFA
# Subsequent connections within 4 hours will use cached token
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT CURRENT_USER(), CURRENT_ROLE()")
print(cursor.fetchone())
```

### 3. JDBC Connections (for Java Applications)

**Connection String:**
```java
String url = "jdbc:snowflake://your-account.snowflakecomputing.com/?" +
             "user=your-username&" +
             "authenticator=username_password_mfa&" +
             "db=RDF_SEMANTIC_DB&" +
             "schema=SEMANTIC_VIEWS&" +
             "warehouse=RDF_DEMO_WH";

Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, "your-username", "your-password");
```

## Token Caching Behavior

### Cache Duration
- **Maximum**: 4 hours from initial authentication
- **Automatic Refresh**: Happens transparently during this period
- **Cross-Session**: Works across multiple SnowSQL/Python sessions

### Cache Invalidation
The MFA token cache is cleared when:
- 4 hours have elapsed since initial authentication
- You change authentication credentials (username/password)
- Account-level caching is disabled
- You manually clear the client keystore

### Cache Storage Locations
- **Windows**: Windows Credential Manager
- **macOS**: Keychain Access
- **Linux**: Secret Service API (gnome-keyring, kwallet, etc.)

## Security Considerations

### Benefits
‚úÖ **Reduced Attack Surface**: Fewer manual MFA interactions  
‚úÖ **Improved UX**: Seamless demo execution  
‚úÖ **Maintained Security**: MFA still required, just cached securely  
‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: All authentication events still logged  

### Security Controls
üîí **Encrypted Storage**: Tokens stored in OS-level secure keystores  
üîí **Time-Limited**: 4-hour maximum cache duration  
üîí **Per-Account**: Tokens are account-specific  
üîí **Revocable**: Account admins can disable caching anytime  

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "MFA token caching not working"
```bash
# Check if caching is enabled at account level
snowsql -q "SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'ALLOW_CLIENT_MFA_CACHING' IN ACCOUNT"

# Should show: TRUE
```

**Issue**: "Keyring package errors"
```bash
# Reinstall with secure storage support
pip uninstall snowflake-connector-python
pip install "snowflake-connector-python[secure-local-storage]"
```

**Issue**: "Still getting MFA prompts"
- Verify authenticator is set to `username_password_mfa`
- Check that credentials haven't changed
- Ensure 4-hour window hasn't expired
- Verify keyring is accessible on your OS

### Clear Cached Tokens (if needed)
```bash
# Python method to clear tokens
python -c "
import keyring
import getpass
user = getpass.getuser()
keyring.delete_password('snowflake_token', user)
print('MFA token cache cleared')
"
```

## Demo-Specific Benefits

When running the RDF to Snowflake demo with MFA caching enabled:

1. **Initial Setup**: One MFA prompt when running `setup_mfa_caching.sql`
2. **UDF Deployment**: No additional MFA prompts for Python UDF creation
3. **Data Processing**: Seamless execution of conversion scripts
4. **Testing**: Multiple query executions without interruption
5. **Development**: Iterative testing and refinement without constant MFA

## Best Practices

### For Demo Environments
1. ‚úÖ Enable MFA caching before starting demo deployment
2. ‚úÖ Use environment variables for connection details
3. ‚úÖ Group related operations to maximize cache benefit
4. ‚úÖ Test connection caching before important demos

### For Production Environments
1. üîç Review with security team before enabling
2. üîç Monitor authentication logs regularly
3. üîç Consider shorter cache durations if required
4. üîç Implement account-level policies consistently

## Monitoring MFA Token Usage

Query to see MFA token cache usage:
```sql
-- View MFA token authentication events
SELECT 
    EVENT_TIMESTAMP,
    USER_NAME,
    IS_SUCCESS,
    SECOND_AUTHENTICATION_FACTOR,
    CLIENT_IP
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.LOGIN_HISTORY 
WHERE SECOND_AUTHENTICATION_FACTOR = 'MFA_TOKEN'
ORDER BY EVENT_TIMESTAMP DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
