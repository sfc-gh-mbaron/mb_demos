# RDF Schema to Snowflake Semantic Views Demo

This demo showcases how to convert RDF (Resource Description Framework) schemas to **Snowflake Semantic Views** using native Snowflake features including Python UDFs and the complete semantic layer capabilities.

## Overview

This comprehensive demo demonstrates the full capabilities of Snowflake's semantic layer, including:

- **Semantic Views** with rich business context and natural language support
- **Tables** with primary keys, synonyms, and detailed comments
- **Relationships** between entities for complex data modeling
- **Facts** for raw numerical data aggregation
- **Dimensions** for categorical analysis and filtering
- **Metrics** with comprehensive business calculations
- **Cortex Analyst Integration** for natural language querying
- **Python UDFs** for automated RDF-to-semantic conversion

## Key Components

### 1. **Sample Data (`sample_data/`)**
- E-commerce RDF schemas in multiple formats (Turtle, JSON-LD)
- Complete domain model with products, customers, orders, suppliers
- Rich semantic relationships and hierarchies

### 2. **Python UDFs (`python_udfs/`)**
- **`rdf_parser_udf.sql`** - Parses RDF schemas and extracts semantic information
- **`semantic_view_ddl_generator.sql`** - Generates complete Snowflake semantic view DDL
- **`rdf_data_loader_udf.sql`** - Loads RDF instance data into semantic structures

### 3. **SQL Scripts (`sql/`)**
- **`01_setup_environment.sql`** - Environment and UDF setup
- **`02_run_conversion_demo.sql`** - Basic conversion demonstration
- **`03_create_semantic_views_demo.sql`** - **Complete semantic views implementation**

### 4. **Examples (`examples/`)**
- **Semantic queries** showcasing advanced capabilities
- **Cortex Analyst integration** examples
- **Natural language query** patterns and use cases

## Snowflake Semantic Views Features Demonstrated

### üèóÔ∏è **Tables**
- Primary key definitions
- Rich synonyms for natural language understanding
- Detailed business comments
- Multiple logical table relationships

### üîó **Relationships**
- Foreign key relationships between entities
- Complex many-to-many relationships through junction tables
- Hierarchical relationships (categories, organizational structures)
- Semantic relationship mapping from RDF object properties

### üìä **Facts**
- Raw numerical data for aggregation (prices, quantities, totals)
- Inventory levels and stock quantities
- Order values and item pricing
- Calculated fields for analysis

### üéØ **Dimensions**
- Categorical attributes for filtering and grouping
- Time-based dimensions (year, month, day of week)
- Derived dimensions (price tiers, stock status)
- Rich synonyms for natural language queries

### üìà **Metrics**
- **Revenue metrics**: Total revenue, average order value, monthly revenue
- **Customer metrics**: Customer lifetime value, repeat customer rate, orders per customer
- **Product metrics**: Average product price, inventory value, out-of-stock count
- **Operational metrics**: Conversion rates, daily orders, items sold

### üí¨ **Cortex Analyst Integration**
- Natural language query support
- Business-friendly synonyms and terminology
- Comprehensive metric calculations
- Rich contextual comments

## Prerequisites

- **Snowflake Account** with Semantic Views support
- **Python UDF** capabilities enabled
- **Cortex Analyst** access (for natural language queries)
- Understanding of RDF concepts and semantic modeling

## Quick Start

1. **Deploy the demo:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy_to_snowflake.sh
   ```

2. **Create semantic views:**
   ```sql
   USE DATABASE RDF_SEMANTIC_DB;
   USE SCHEMA SEMANTIC_VIEWS;
   @sql/03_create_semantic_views_demo.sql
   ```

3. **Explore with natural language:**
   - "What was our total revenue last year?"
   - "Show me top customers by orders"
   - "Which products are out of stock?"

## Key Features

### üåê **RDF Integration**
- Multiple RDF serialization format support (Turtle, JSON-LD, RDF/XML)
- RDFS and OWL construct handling
- Semantic relationship preservation
- Automated ontology-to-database mapping

### üß† **Semantic Intelligence**
- Rich business context through comments and synonyms
- Natural language query capabilities through Cortex Analyst
- Intuitive metric definitions for business users
- Comprehensive dimensional modeling

### ‚ö° **Production Ready**
- Optimized semantic view definitions
- Scalable Python UDF architecture
- Performance-optimized table structures
- Enterprise-grade security and governance

### üîç **Advanced Analytics**
- Complex business metric calculations
- Time-series analysis capabilities
- Customer segmentation and analysis
- Inventory management insights
- Revenue and profitability analysis

## Natural Language Query Examples

With the semantic views, users can ask business questions in natural language:

- **Revenue Analysis**: "What's our monthly revenue trend?"
- **Customer Insights**: "Who are our top customers by lifetime value?"
- **Inventory Management**: "Which products need restocking?"
- **Performance Metrics**: "Show me our best-selling categories"
- **Operational Analysis**: "What's our average order value by month?"

## What Makes This Demo Special

1. **Complete Semantic Layer**: Full implementation of Snowflake's semantic view capabilities
2. **RDF Integration**: Bridges semantic web technologies with modern data warehousing
